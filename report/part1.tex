\section{Part 1: Identification of the boat  parameters}

In the assignment text we were given the following model of a ship:
\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
				\dot{\xi_w} &= \phi_w\\
				\dot{\phi_w} &= -\omega_0^2\xi_w-2\lambda\omega_0\phi_w+K_ww_w\\
				\dot{\phi} &= r\\
				\dot{r} &= -\frac{1}{T}r+\frac{K}{T}(\delta-b)\\
				\dot{b} &= w_b\\
				y &= \phi + \phi_w + v
		\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Where $\phi$ is the average heading, $\phi_w$ is a high frequency component due to the wave disturbance, $r$ the yaw rate and b is a bias to the rudder angle $\delta$.
