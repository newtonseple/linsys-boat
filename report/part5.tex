\section{Discrete Kalman filter}

\subsection{5a)}

To make a discrete Kalman filter we need to discretize the model found in \cref{subsec:4a}. The discretized system can be found using the equations

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        A_d &= e^{AT_s} \\
        B_d &= \int_0^{T_s} e^{A\tau}B d\tau \\
        E_d &= \int_0^{T_s} e^{A\tau}E d\tau \\
        C_d &= C
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

This can be done using he MatLab function \texttt{[Ad, Bd] = c2d(A, B, Ts)} to get the discretized matrices $A_d$ and $B_d$ discretized with a timestep of \texttt{Ts}. To get the model discretized with a sampling frequency of $10\si{\hertz}$ we set \texttt{Ts} to $0.1$. In order to get $E_d$ we use the same function, but swap \texttt{Bd} and \texttt{B} with \texttt{Ed} and \texttt{E}. The resulting $A_d$, $B_d$ and $E_d$ matrices are

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        A_d &= \begin{bmatrix}
        0.1000 & 0.0993 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        -0.0607 & 0.9841 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0.0999 & -1.0063 \cdot 10^{-5} \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1000 & -0.0002 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix} \\
        B_d &= \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        1.0062 \cdot 10^{-5} \\
        0.0002 \\
        0
        \end{bmatrix} \\
        E_ d &= \begin{bmatrix}
        2.4880\cdot 10^{-5} & 0 \\
        0.0005 & 0 \\
        0 & -3.3545\cdot 10^{-7} \\
        0 & -1.0063\cdot 10^{-5} \\
        0 & 0.1000
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{5b)}

Another thing we need to make a Kalman filter is the variance of the measurement noise. The variance was found by simulating long timeseries of the ship with a input of zero, and with measurement noise turned on. The variance was found using the MatLab function \texttt{ts\_var = var(ts)}, where \texttt{ts} is a timeseries, and \texttt{ts\_var} is the variance of the timeseries. The variance of the measurement noise was found to be $0.002$. However this is in degrees squared, whereas we want the variance in radians (squared). This gives us a variance of $6.0923 \cdot 10^{-6}$.
